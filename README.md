Simply download all files and put them in the directory you'd like.
To download the files navigate to the repository https://github.com/skaterdude97/csci-2020u-TeamHypeSpamFilter and download all project
files.

Open the project in IntelliJ and run the program. 
Once the Program is running it will prompt you to chose a directory. Select the "/data" directory that came within the .zip file and
select "open". The program will then train itself and test itself displaying the test results in a table along with accuracy and 
precision.

The improvement we made to this program is we have added the capabilities of blacklisting email addresses. Teh user first inputs an 
email address into the text field located at the bottom and then presses "Add" wich adds the email to a blacklist. Then hit the "Retest"
button and it will update the results based on the email address entered.
